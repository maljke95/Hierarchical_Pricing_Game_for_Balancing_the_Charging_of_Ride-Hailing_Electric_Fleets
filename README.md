**Abstract:** Due to the ever-increasing popularity of ride-
hailing services and the indisputable shift towards alterna-
tive fuel vehicles, the intersection of the ride-hailing market
and smart electric mobility provides an opportunity to trade
different services to achieve societal optimum. In this work,
we present a hierarchical, game-based, control mechanism
for balancing the simultaneous charging of multiple ride-
hailing fleets. The mechanism takes into account some-
times conflicting interests of the ride-hailing drivers, the
ride-hailing company management, and the external agents
such as power-providing companies or city governments
that will play a significant role in charging management in
the future. The upper-level control considers charging price
incentives and models the interactions between the exter-
nal agents and ride-hailing companies as a Reverse Stack-
elberg game with a single leader and multiple followers.
The lower-level control motivates the revenue-maximizing
drivers to follow the company operator’s requests through
surge pricing and models the interactions as a single
leader, multiple followers Stackelberg game. We provide a
pricing mechanism that ensures the existence of a unique
Nash equilibrium of the upper-level game that minimizes
the external agent’s objective at the same time. We pro-
vide theoretical and experimental robustness analysis of
the upper-level control with respect to parameters whose
values depend on sensitive information that might not be
entirely accessible to the external agent. For the lower-
level algorithm, we combine the Nash equilibrium of the
upper-level game with a quadratic mixed integer optimiza-
tion problem to find the optimal surge prices. Finally, we
illustrate the performance of the control mechanism in a
case study based on real taxi data from Shenzhen in China.
